# Cyclistic Case Study

I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. It is hands-on program that aims to equip individuals with proper knowledge and skills to be a great data analyst in the future. It consists of 8 courses that tackles data preparation, exploration, manipulation, and visualization. Technical tools such as spreadsheets, SQL, R, and Tableau were covered which definitely helped me improve my skills in using them. Throughout the program, I learned about the data analysis process and applied it on a case study. 


### Summary
This case study is part of the eighth course of the program where I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I gained. R was used for performing data wrangling and manipulation and Tableau for data visualization. 

### About the Company 
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 


## Data Analysis Phase

### Ask 
The finance analysts at the company have concluded that having annual members is much more profitable than having casual riders. Although the flexibility of the pricing plans can really attract new customers,  Moreno, the director of marketing, believes that converting casual riders to annual members is the key for the growth of revenue and profit of the company. In order to achieve that goal, the company's historical data will be used to identify trends and essential information on how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently. 

### Prepare
The Cyclistic's historical trip data is used and provided on Google Data Analytics program. It is exactly downloaded from here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. While the name of the company (Cyclistic) is fictional, the data is based on a real company in City of Chicago and has been made available by Motivate International Inc.. As part of the agreement of the company and the city, the data is made available to the public but is subject to terms and conditions.

Personal Identifiable Information and other confidential data were already removed to avoid data-privacy issues. The data set includes station names, latitude & longitude, bike type used, date started and ended which could really help to analyze the difference between user types. 

### Process
Upon downloading the data sets, it was noticed that it has a very big file size. Thus, importing and processing the data in SQL or R was more suitable than doing it in Excel or Google Sheets. But R was chosen for this case study due to personal preference. The data set was checked for errors and cleaned by removing out of range values, missing values,and duplicate instances. Data types of fields were checked to ensure it consistency and validity. Some fields were also transformed or added. For detailed process check the data cleaning file above.
